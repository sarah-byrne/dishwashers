# Learning questions

1. What's the difference between js and jsx files? So far we have used js but are not sure whether we are missing out on anything.
2. How to use Mono
3. Understand more about Next.js - what does that give us over Create React App?
   - it does routing for you
4. Go through React official docs and think of ways to practise the concepts within this project

# ToDo

2. Remove dishwashers h1 from ProductGrid
