# dishwashers

displays dishwasher information obtained from an API

# Where we are up to

    We have all the data in the ProductSummary and completed unit testing of that component.   We have styled that component but are
    struggling to style the ProductGrid.   We think this is because we haven't configured node-sass yet - we think we
    need to follow instructions in https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-sass

# Learning questions

1. What's the difference between js and jsx files? So far we have used js but are not sure whether we are missing out on anything.
2. How to use Mono
3. Understand more about Next.js - what does that give us over Create React App?
   - it does routing for you
4. Go through React official docs and think of ways to practise the concepts within this project

# ToDo

1. Change ProductGrid.test to be a snapshot test instead of find text.
2. Remove dishwashers h1 from ProductGrid
3. Create jest tests for index.js
4. Implement ProductSummary into ProductGrid.
